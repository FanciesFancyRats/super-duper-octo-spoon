tuples list are orderded sequences of objects
dictionaries are not ordered
lists are mutable
to append a list use:
L.append(e)

is not assigning is actually changing the list
append is a method, think of it as an alternative syntax for a function
instead of append(L, e)
L.append(e)
for i in list:
will do something to each item in the list
+ will combine multiple lists
.sort is a built in function that will put items in alphabetical order
assignment changes binding, mutation changes values
L1 = [2]
L2 = [L1, L1]
print L2 >>> [2, 2]
L1[0] = 3
print L2 >> [3, 3]
L2[0] = 'a'
print L2 >> [a, 3]
L1 = [2]
print L2 >> [a, 3]
L1 = [2] is assigning L1 to [2] but does not mutate it as L1[0] = [2] would.
alias is one object with multiple names
