syntax is the 'grammer' (the way the language and tokens are put together to form statments) of the programming language. a + b(valid) vs a b + (invalid) 
	"I am" vs "I cat"
static semantics, example (2 + "Hello world") The commands are valid but the individual tokens aren't usable in the command. "I are cool" vs "I am cool"
semantics error, runs but doesn't do what you want it to do. "Chicken ate me" vs "I ate chicken"

sequence of expression

variable name, assignment opperator, string literal
myVar = "a string"
operand are literal and variables etc
opperator are things like = 'do things to things'
everything in python is an object
objects have types int, float, string, boolean
