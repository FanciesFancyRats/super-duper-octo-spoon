Recursion
Dicts let you associate any data type with a key
the keys can be tuples, list, strings
breaking code into function is an example of "modular abstraction"
makes it eariser to use re-use code, and easier to debug
and example of "divide and conqure"
	-small problems are easier to solve
	-solutions to small problems can easily be combined
	 to solve the big problem
Recursion
	-Way of describing or defining problems
	-Way of desinging solutions(d&c)
natural us born citizen
	1 born in us citizen
	2 one parent us citizen
Base case
	-typically direct answer
Recursive (inductive case)
	-reduce to simpler version of same problem plus other simple operations
b^n = {b*b*b...b}n
    = b * {b...b}n-1
    b^n = b*b^n-1 if n > 0
	  if n = 0 b = 1
