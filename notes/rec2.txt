for [keyword] i [variable] in[keyword] [inumerable object]
for loops iterate over numerable objects.
range function takes 1-3 paramaters and returns 1
	first peramiter is inclusive second is exclusive
range(1, 100, 2)
1 start inclusive, 100 end exclusive, 2 step
starts from 1 ends 99 and increments 2?
in python's help module [] are option peramiters
tuple is a non-scalar data type that can hold many items
	scalar can hold one element
	non-scalar data type can hold more than one item
python will accept negative 'indecies' for navigating tuples, it will start at the end of the tuple
	tuple1 = (1, 2, 3)
	tuple1[-1] -> 2?
	nope, 3
immutable data types are unchangable, changing a tuple after it has been assigned will give the error, "this data type does not support assignment"
slicing [(begining location):(end location((exclusive!)))]
	one pass the range we want
@ 21:29
slice [x:] slice from x to end of index
slice [:] take slice that is entire index
you can use negative indicies in slice, they start from the last like tuple[-1]
() is the grouping operator in python, if you need to make a tuple of one item (x,)
strings are also unmutable, support interation. Strings have built in function uppercase lowercase find and replace.

For loop and break statment can be used in place of while loop
