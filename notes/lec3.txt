Programming languages are an abstraction form binary machine code and various types of assembly low level languages

Decrementing function (garentes a loop will terminate)
1) Map set of program variables to and int
2) starts with a non-negative value
3) When value <= 0, loop terminates
4) Decreased each time through the loop

In cube.py abs(x) - ans^3 is the decrementing function.
(Does not always need to be a declared vairable)
ex: 8 - 0 = 8
    8 - 1^3 = 7
    8 - 2^3 = 2
    8 - 3^3 = -1 (stops here)
Exhaustive enumeration, systematically checks for answers while interating.
