Don't test wether floating point. Because of floating point aritimatic
binary cannot finetly represent 0.1 for instance so it must be rounded.
This usually isn't a problem but can accumulate over many iterations.

The goal of debbuging is to move towards a bug-free program.
Debuggers are programs avaliable to help debugging, though not a nesscesity.
"How could it have produced the results that it did?" vs "Why did it not produce the desired results"
Study avaliable data, form hypotises, design and run a repeatable experiment
must have potential to refute hypthoesis.
Use a "test harness" to debug. About 1/2 of the code written is for testing and debugging and is not used in final product.
