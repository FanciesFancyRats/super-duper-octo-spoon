Begin by breaking the string apart from the begining of the string to the start location.
Divinding the string into notShifting and toBeShifted text
For every shift in the range 27 apply it to the theBeShifted string
	for every possible shift divide this string into a list of words, seperated by spaces and special characters.

if a valid word is found move the start location by the length of the word plus it's space
test if the next word is valid
when an invalid word is found break and record the shift
apply this shift to the toBeShifted string
concatenate notShifting and toBeshifted(which has been shifted)
check if the start location is now at the end
if not make a recursive call to the functi
